# About Me

I am an Information Technology professional with over 15 years of experience, working in areas ranging from technical support and strategic ICT management to the development of customized solutions with Python. My career includes task automation, web scraping, APIs, IoT, and data science, always focused on efficiency and innovation.

In recent years, I have dedicated myself to developing software for process optimization, such as robots for data collection and analysis, systems for cloud infrastructure management, and automation. I have experience with frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Selenium, as well as infrastructure based on Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services (AWS and Azure).

In addition to the technical side, my experience in public administration has given me a strategic vision for IT solutions, ensuring that each project is aligned with business needs and generates real results.

I share insights and projects on my blog and GitHub, exploring topics such as automation, software engineering, and business intelligence. If you want to exchange ideas about technology and innovative solutions, connect with me!
